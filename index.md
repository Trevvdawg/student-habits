# Student Habits Analysis Project

![Student Habits Project](Student_Habits_Social_Preview2.png)

Welcome to my data analytics project exploring how student habits influence academic performance.

This project uses statistical analysis and machine learning to investigate how variables such as study hours, attendance, extracurricular participation, and parental background affect exam scores.

---

## 📊 Key Findings

✅ **Study Hours** → Strongest predictor of exam scores  
✅ **Attendance** → Weak but significant positive effect  
✅ **Parental Education Level** → No statistically significant effect in this dataset  
✅ **Extracurricular Participation** → No significant impact detected
